# Silva rerum
Forest of things, some singular & simple tools and configs, that can be useful to be preserved. 

Mostly scripts (bash / powershell / python). They are unrelated, in random order, and are not guaranteed to work (worked on my machine :) ).
It's a quick repo to save code, some of it if considered more useful, might find its own place later.
